                The white-bellied go-away bird gets its name from its distinctive call, which sounds like "go-away."
                It has grey plumage, a white belly, and a large crest on top of its head.
                The bird also has white markings on its tail, which become visible when it is in flight.
            </p>
            <p>
                White-bellied go-away birds inhabit the arid savannahs and woodlands of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, 
                South Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IUCN lists this bird as "Least Concern," meaning there are no major threats to its survival at present.
