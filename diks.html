                The dik-dik is a type of dwarf antelope that lives in arid regions of East Africa. 
                They can survive in such dry environments by obtaining water from the vegetation they eat. 
                They also take cover in undergrowth to protect themselves from predators, including eagles and wild cats.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are four species of dik-diks, but only two are found in Kenya: Guenther's dik-dik and Kirk's dik-dik. 
                Kirk's dik-dik is the largest, though it remains small compared to other antelopes. It stands at just 
                45 centimeters (18 inches) tall and weighs only 7.2 kilograms (15.8 pounds). Guenther's dik-dik is smaller 
                but has a longer snout.

            <p>
                The IUCN lists both Kirk's dik-dik and Guenther's dik-dik as species of "Least Concern." However, 
                they are threatened by expanding agricultural settlements and excessive hunting in some areas.
