                There are two species of hyenas in Kenya—the striped hyena and the spotted hyena. 
                They can be found throughout Africa, in all habitats except rainforests.

                The spotted hyena (also called the laughing hyena) is the largest hyena species, 
                with females being larger than males. Their coats are patterned with dark spots. 
                These animals hunt fish, birds, and even hippo calves, and they can work in packs to take down 
                wildebeests or antelopes.

            <p>
                Striped hyenas are lesser-known than their spotted cousins. They are more scavengers than hunters 
                and typically come out at night to feed on carcasses left by other animals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IUCN lists the spotted hyena as "Least Concern," while the striped hyena is classified as "Near Threatened." 
                Human-wildlife conflict is the main threat to their survival.
