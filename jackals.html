                The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family. It has a rusty red coat with a black patch on its back and a black-tipped tail. 
                It measures around 95 centimeters (37 inches) from head to tail.

                As opportunistic omnivores, jackals eat whatever they can. They work in family packs to hunt small antelopes, 
                but they also feed on reptiles, insects, birds, fruits, berries, and carcasses left by larger predators.

                There are two distinct populations of black-backed jackals in Africa—one in East Africa and another in southern Africa, 
                in countries including Namibia, Angola, and South Africa. These animals live in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts to 
                grasslands to savannahs.

                The IUCN lists black-backed jackals as "Least Concern," meaning they face few immediate threats. However, they are often 
                hunted by farmers who kill them to protect their livestock.
