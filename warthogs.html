                The desert warthog is a member of the pig family. It has a large, warty head, 
                a coarse mane, and two pairs of tusks. Unlike the common warthog, which is found across 
                most of Africa, the desert warthog is only found in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia.

            <p>
                It inhabits savannah and shrubland areas, where it feeds on grass and other vegetation. 
                It also takes shelter in abandoned aardvark burrows to escape predators and extreme weather.

                The IUCN lists the desert warthog as "Least Concern." However, the population in Kenya faces 
                increasing threats due to the growing number of humans and livestock, which leads to more 
                competition for water and food.
